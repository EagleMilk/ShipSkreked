Assignment: "Today's Python Exam"

Created Feb 7Feb 7
NOT DONE
Today's Python Exam
Today we focus on Python strings. You have been sent an email invitation from hackerrank, please let me know if you didn't get it. The first two problems demonstrate competency and either of the second two demonstrate mastery. Note: these are all beginner problems.

You may use the internet to find things out like 'how do I loop through a string in python' or 'how do I check if a string contains a letter in python', but you may not copy an entire solution.

You can always ask for help.

Hints:

word = 'flummoxed'
for letter in word:
print letter

letter = 'q'
if not letter in word:
print letter
